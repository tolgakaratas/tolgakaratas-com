The Denomas Management Automation Platform is an integrated automation software platform designed for managed infrastructures. It facilitates compliance with security standards specified in ISO 27001, PCI DSS, NIST, and the Presidential Digital Transformation Office's Information and Communication Security Guide. By managing unified or distributed online service infrastructures, it increases overall quality and management efficiency, generates savings, and reduces errors and outages.

**Core Features and Advantages:**

* **Integrated Automation:** Offers a wide range of automation, from the installation and operation methods of components in online service infrastructures to access permissions, clustering, cloud, and virtualization platforms, and integrated management of software packages, source codes, and application platforms.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Contains ready-made scenarios for quickly bringing up the entire system automatically, necessary for Disaster Recovery.
* **Comprehensive Management:** Covers all management processes, from centralized/distributed inventory management to maintenance personnel's areas of authority, data recording and backup locations, secure inter-application communication, and notification of stakeholders about system events.
* **SDLC and CI/CD Integration:** Provides full SDLC and CI/CD integration, from writing software source code to publishing, updating, and removing it. Helps detect potential errors earlier and more easily.
* **Easy Migration and Use:** Offers ready-made solutions for migration projects to Linux and open-source applications. Eliminates installation, configuration, and maintenance difficulties, centralizing integration at a single point.
* **Workload Reduction:** Reduces daily system management workload by up to 95%. Simplifies and automates system management activities.
* **Uninterrupted Service:** Increases service continuity and user satisfaction, helping to prevent financial and commercial losses caused by business and service interruptions.
* **Standardization:** Simplifies compliance with existing standards and helps integrate SDLC and CI/CD structures by creating digital twins of systems.
