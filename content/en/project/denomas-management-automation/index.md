### Project Goal
The Denomas Management Automation Platform is an integrated automation software platform designed for managed infrastructures. Its purpose is to facilitate compliance with international security standards such as ISO 27001, PCI DSS, and NIST, and to increase overall quality and management efficiency by managing unified or distributed online service infrastructures. The platform aims to provide significant savings to organizations by reducing errors and outages.

### Technologies Used
The platform is designed to manage almost every component found in a modern DevOps and system management ecosystem:
- **Automation & Configuration:** Ansible, Salt, Terraform
- **Cloud & Virtualization:** AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, Docker, Proxmox, VMware
- **CI/CD & Version Control:** GitLab, Jenkins, Git, Bitbucket
- **Databases & Services:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, NGINX, Apache
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Icinga, Zabbix, Nagios, LibreNMS, Wazuh, Kibana
- **Security Tools:** Fail2ban, AppArmor, Suricata, Wazuh

### My Role and Contributions
As the founder and chief architect of this platform, I created the strategic vision for the project and led all technical development. My primary goal was to create an integrated solution that automates all processes, from disaster recovery scenarios to daily operations, by combining infrastructure management with the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principle. By designing SDLC and CI/CD integrations, I made the software development and deployment processes more secure and efficient.

### Key Features
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Includes ready-made scenarios that allow the entire system to be automatically rebuilt in seconds in case of a disaster.
- **End-to-End Automation:** Manages the entire lifecycle from a single point, from the installation of infrastructure components and access permissions to the management of source code and backups.
- **Up to 95% Workload Reduction:** Significantly reduces the daily system management workload through automation, allowing teams to focus on more strategic tasks.
- **Full Compliance with Standards:** Simplifies compliance with security standards like ISO 27001 and PCI DSS and facilitates audit processes by creating digital twins of the systems.
